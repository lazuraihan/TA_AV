## IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ORB-SLAM3 ALGORITHM ON AUTONOMOUS CAR PERCEPTION AND LOCALIZATION SYSTEM WITH DEPTH MAP BASED LIDAR-CAMERA FUSION SENSOR

This project has objective to implement the RGB-L (LiDAR) mode based on the ORB-SLAM3. This allows to integrate LiDAR depth measurement with camera to create more precision SLAM result and less computation time.
The algorithm is a fork from [ORB_SLAM3_RGBL](https://github.com/TUMFTM/ORB_SLAM3_RGBL)
